Being on board with Kunal Shah's delta 4 theory (linked below) - which highlights the irreversible changes technology can bring that society has to inevitably adapt to, I strived this year to explore uprising technologies like blockchain, AI, NFTs, and others, and share my learning openly on this platform.<br/>

In alignment with my goal below is my first contribution<br/>

🔍 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐀𝐈 - 𝐕𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐆𝐏𝐓 (𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐀𝐈 𝐆𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐬 𝐒𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞𝐬):
In my exploration, I've elevated AI by integrating GPT models with the Google Speech API to birth VoiceGPT. Unlike ChatGPT, which excels in text, VoiceGPT not only understands written prompts but also hears and responds in kind. <br/>

💡 𝐀𝐈'𝐬 𝐍𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐫: 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐃𝐀𝐋𝐋-𝐄:
What lies ahead? The next frontier involves integrating VoiceGPT with DALL-E, a system that adds a visual dimension. This evolution propels AI into a realm where it gains senses—seeing, hearing, and responding. 👀🤯<br/>

🔬 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐃𝐢𝐯𝐞: 𝐁𝐞𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐜𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐬:
Libraries & Modules: Flask, OpenAI, ResponsiveVoice.js
APIs: Google Speech API, OpenAI API
Development Platform: Replit (Read Evaluate Print Loop)<br/>

💡 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧 - 𝐕𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐬 𝐚 𝐁𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐁𝐥𝐨𝐛:
VoiceGPT leverages the power of Blob objects for seamless voice transmission between the client and server. Here's a peek into the technicalities: the voice data is converted into binary format, represented as a Blob object, and sent as a binary file from the client/browser to the server. <br/>

🌐 𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐌𝐚𝐝𝐞 𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐭:
Developing and deploying VoiceGPT was a breeze with Replit. A Repl means Read Evaluate Print Loop and replit rightly is such a platform providing an ideal coding environment, eliminating the need for complex setup procedures for development and deployment. <br/>

🚀 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐕𝐨𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐆𝐏𝐓 𝐍𝐨𝐰:
Curious minds, enthusiasts, and tech aficionados, I invite you to explore VoiceGPT which currently supports over 30 languages. Witness the intersection of AI and human interaction, and feel free to share your thoughts, suggestions, and feedback. 🚀🔗<br/>

Note: current interface is not optimised for mobile phones and tablets, kindly check it out on laptop screen<br/>
